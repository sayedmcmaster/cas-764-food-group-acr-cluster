\section{Objectives}

\flushleft \justifying Your course project will investigate a new idea in an area of data management. Projects will be judged
based on originality, scientific merit, depth of content, and thoroughness of evaluation. At the end of
the term, each student will do a project presentation, and submit a final project paper.

\flushleft \justifying The aim of the course project is for you to investigate (in-depth) a related research question (problem) tied to data management and (possibly) your own research area. You will identify a research problem, and likely do preliminary readings to gain an understanding of related work in the area.
In your presentation, you should be able to convince the class why your problem is important, why
itâ€™s difficult, and why your solution is good/better than past approaches. Presentation details will be
discussed in a separate set of slides presented in class.
