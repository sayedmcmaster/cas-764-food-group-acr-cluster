\section{Experiments}
I used the Experiments as shown in Figure ~\ref{experiment-regular-clustering} to find associations between dietary patterns (i.e. Food Groups) and ACR. For the regression experiments, both Actual Values and Normalized values are used. However, I have reported only regression-based results based on the experiments done on normalized data. Similar experiments could be done with the clusters that I created using K-Means. I have provided experiment design for K-Means Clustered Data in Figure ~\ref{experiment-regular-kmeans-clustering} to conduct similar experiments. These experiments on Clustered Data could discover additional valuable relations and associations.
